        Microblade<br>
          Microblading is a tattooing technique in which each hair stroke is created by hand using a small handheld tool that utilizes tiny needles to make micro cuts in the skin.  Microblading is used on the eyebrows to create, enhance and reshape their appearance in terms of both shape and color.  This method differs from the sofTap procedure because it gives a more natural look of individual hair strokes in the eyebrow. This is a permanent procedure.<br><br>
        Stoftap/Shade<br>
          The sofTap hand method of permanent makeup is a gentle way to implant permanent color into the skin.  The sofTap needle configurations are designed to provide maximum comfort, fast healing, complete control, and little or no touchups.  Like microblading, sofTap is used to shape and color your eyebrows but sofTap is more of a “full coverage” method. It is used to fill the complete area of the brow.<br><br>
<br>
<br>
      Permanent Eyeliner<br>
        Permanent eyeliner is a tattooing procedure right above the eyelash line to simulate eyeliner makeup.  All eyeliner procedures are paired with a complimentary eyelash enhancement.  The enhancement is used to fill in the lashes, creating a thicker, darker, and completely fuller look without the obvious look of heavy makeup.<br><br><br>

      <h3>Fequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <p>

What is cosmetic tattooing?<br>
•	Cosmetic tattooing describes the process of implanting pigment into the dermal layer of the skin.  The process is purely cosmetic, but when it is used to camouflage scars or to reconstruct areolas and nipples after a mastectomy, it can go a long way toward improving self-esteem.<br><br>
What equipment is used?<br>
•	A variety of machines can be used to perform cosmetic tattooing.  For my procedures I use a battery powered pen, microblade, and SofTap needles. For the health and safety of my clients, all my needles are sterile. (used once and thrown away)<br><br>
Are the results permanent?<br>
•	Cosmetic tattoos are permanent tattoos.  The color is inserted into the dermal layer of the skin and cannot be washed off.  As with any tattoo, proper care extends the color life of the tattoo.  Factors that contribute to a faster rate of color fading are exposure to the sun, use of cell regeneration products (retin-a, alpha hydroxy acids, etc…), very dry skin, and very oily skin.  Touchups can be necessary for many areas of the face, where there is friction or faster cell regeneration.<br><br>
How long will the procedure take?<br>
•	The initial consultation usually lasts approximately 30 minutes.  Once we start the procedure, you can plan on 1.5 to 2 hours.  <br>
•	A second detail session will usually be required in 6 – 8 weeks after the initial procedure.  Touchups will take less time if we don’t need to redraw the shape.<br>
•	Color should last 1-3 years after the initial touchup.<br><br>
Does everyone require a patch test?<br>
•	Most people do not require a patch test.  If you are concerned about allergies it might be beneficial.<br><br>
Does it hurt?<br>
•	This is a tattooing procedure, and everyone’s comfort level is different.  However, I use topical numbing agents that assist in any discomfort you might feel. Little or no bruising should result from procedures.  Most people describe the sensation of permanent makeup to that of tweezing eyebrows.
