        <p class="home-paragraph-1">
          Amber Rausch is a passionate mother of five children and understands
          the difficulty of getting children ready along with herself each
          morning. She became excited about permanent cosmetics with the goal of
          helping others who have the same struggles as she does. She is a
          licensed and insured permanent cosmetic artist with a great attention
          to detail, and a devotion to her clients.

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">Microblading</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">
          Microblading is a tattooing technique in which each hair stroke is
          created by hand using a small handheld tool that utilizes tiny needles
          to make micro cuts in the skin. Microblading is used on the eyebrows
          to create, enhance and reshape their appearance in terms of both shape
          and color. This method differs from the sofTap procedure because it
          gives a more natural look of individual hair strokes in the eyebrow.
          This is a permanent procedure.

        <h2 class="home-headline-3">SofTap/Shade</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-3">
          The sofTap hand method of permanent makeup is a gentle way to implant
          permanent color into the skin. The sofTap needle configurations are
          designed to provide maximum comfort, fast healing, complete control,
          and little or no touchups. Like microblading, sofTap is used to shape
          and color your eyebrows but sofTap is more of a “full coverage”
          method. It is used to fill the complete area of the brow.

        <h2 class="home-headline-4">Permanent Eyeliner</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-4">
          Permanent eyeliner is a tattooing procedure right above the eyelash
          line to simulate eyeliner makeup. All eyeliner procedures are paired
          with a complimentary eyelash enhancement. The enhancement is used to
          fill in the lashes, creating a thicker, darker, and completely fuller
          look without the obvious look of heavy makeup.
