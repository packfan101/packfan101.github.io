        <button class="accordion">What is cosmetic tattooing?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Cosmetic tattooing describes the process of implanting pigment into the dermal layer of the skin.  The process is purely cosmetic, but when it is used to camouflage scars or to reconstruct areolas and nipples after a mastectomy, it can go a long way toward improving self-esteem.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What equipment is used?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>A variety of machines can be used to perform cosmetic tattooing.  For my procedures I use a battery powered pen, microblade, and SofTap needles. For the health and safety of my clients, all my needles are sterile. (used once and thrown away)</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Are the results permanent?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Cosmetic tattoos are permanent tattoos.  The color is inserted into the dermal layer of the skin and cannot be washed off.  As with any tattoo, proper care extends the color life of the tattoo.  Factors that contribute to a faster rate of color fading are exposure to the sun, use of cell regeneration products (retin-a, alpha hydroxy acids, etc…), very dry skin, and very oily skin.  Touchups can be necessary for many areas of the face, where there is friction or faster cell regeneration.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How long will the procedure take?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The initial consultation usually lasts approximately 30 minutes.  Once we start the procedure, you can plan on 1.5 to 2 hours.  <br>
          A second detail session will usually be required in 6 – 8 weeks after the initial procedure.  Touchups will take less time if we don’t need to redraw the shape.<br>
          Color should last 1-3 years after the initial touchup.</p>
        </div>
		  
        <button class="accordion">Does everyone require a patch test?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Most people do not require a patch test.  If you are concerned about allergies it might be beneficial.</p>
        </div>
		  
        <button class="accordion">Does it hurt?</button>
		    <div class="panel">
  			    <p>This is a tattooing procedure, and everyone’s comfort level is different.  However, I use topical numbing agents that assist in any discomfort you might feel. Little or no bruising should result from procedures.  Most people describe the sensation of permanent makeup to that of tweezing eyebrows.</p>
