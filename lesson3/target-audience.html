      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        This website will target all the residents in the local community. This
        includes the residents of Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. The
        site will benefit people who need the current weather conditions for the
        local area. It will also target residents that are interested in keeping
        up with local events and news. Most residents age ten and up have access
        to electronic devices that they can use to keep up with changes on the
        website. The website will be most popular with adults of all ages as
        they are typically the ones that organize schedules and make the types
        of trips that require up to date knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weather changes quickly in Southeast Idaho, and residents are constantly
        checking weather conditions before making trips. Going outside for
        bicycling, camping, and hiking are common reasons residents look at the
        weather, but depending on the time of year residents will keep an eye on
        weather conditions when preparing to go shopping or take children to
        school.
