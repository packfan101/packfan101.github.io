      <h1>Site Plan</h1>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>This website targets local businesses who would like to improve their presence in the community.  
        These businesses may be of any size from small startups to large corporations. The website utilizes features such as advertising and marketing
        resources to help member businesses reach more customers and increase their businesses. 
      
        There is more temptation to shop online every day because of the convenience that it brings.  The chamber seeks to keep as much of that shopping
        as possible at home in the local community.  Businesses of any size can benefit from these efforts and make a profit by providing needed products
        to its community population.</p>

          <h3>Dave</h3>
          <h4>Jen-Tech Automotive</h4>
          <p>Dave is a small business owner that has a small company dedicated to supplying local automotive repair shops with parts and tools they need to 
          get their jobs done.  He is the only employee in his company right now, but benefits greatly by networking with other businesses that are members
          of the chamber.  He has grown his business by utilizing communications with automotive shops that are also members of the chamber.

          <h3>Mark</h3>
          <h4>Piedmont Construction</h4>
          <p>Mark is a small business owner that builds high-end custom homes for a select market. Because of the limited work he is able to do, and the limited
          clientelle that is looking for the quality custom designs he provides, every dollar he spends on supplies counts toward his bottom line.  He utilizes 
          the chamber to create and improve relationships with distributors that can supply him with products he needs.  These relationships have accumulated 
          significant savings for him in his industry, and made him profitable enough to hire more local employees while expanding his business.
